Dotfiles
========
This is my dot files collection for cloning my Ubuntu Linux configuration  

The starting point for these files was http://github.com/startup-class/dotfiles.  

These files are also setup to work on Mac OSX (El Capitan)  

I'm attempting to use git submodules to include the work of others.
Check out https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt for a great bash prompt.

:TODO set terminal profile font to size 14

To use powerline fonts in virtual terminal (ctrl-alt-f1)
``` bash
sudo cp fonts/Terminus/PSF/*.gz /usr/share/consolefonts/
```
