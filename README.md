Dotfiles
========
This is my dot files collection for cloning my Ubuntu Linux configuration

The starting point for these files was http://github.com/startup-class/dotfiles.

See [Startup Engineering Video Lectures 4a/4b](https://class.coursera.org/startup-001/lecture/index) for more details.

These files are also setup to work on Mac OSX (El Capitan)
