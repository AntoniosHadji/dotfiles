# tty_tickets       If set, users must authenticate on a per-tty basis.
#                   With this flag enabled, sudo will use a separate record
#                   in the time stamp file for each tty.  If disabled, a
#                   single record is used for all login sessions.  This

#env_reset         If set, sudo will run the command in a minimal environment
#                 containing the TERM, PATH, HOME, MAIL, SHELL, LOGNAME,
#                 USER, USERNAME and SUDO_* variables.  Any variables in the
#                 caller's environment that match the env_keep and env_check
#                 lists are then added, followed by any variables present in
#                 the file specified by the env_file option (if any).  The
#                 contents of the env_keep and env_check lists, as modified
#                 by global Defaults parameters in sudoers, are displayed
#                 when sudo is run by root with the -V option.  If the
#                 secure_path option is set, its value will be used for the
#                 PATH environment variable.  This flag is on by default.
